Cannot buy a bucket

Most people in frustration
Shout out
Dayum
I can't BUY a bucket.

As if all the money in the world
Could make a person
A better
Baller.

It's absolutely true.
One cannot buy a bucket.
That's why, after practice
and practice
and more practice,
when the hard work starts to pay off,
it's possible to see the bright side of things.

I can't buy a bucket.
But I can work for it.
And even if I continue to miss,
My personal sense of satisfaction
Is mine to keep.

Creating a pull request just because I can.
